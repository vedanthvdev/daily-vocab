**Description:**

```
Dayink is a quiet daily vocabulary ritual.

Each day you get one word with a short, plain explanation. Choose Beginner, Intermediate, or Hard, then add the Dayink widget to your Lock Screen so today’s word is waiting when you glance at your phone.

• One locked word per day — no endless scrolling
• Three difficulty levels
• On-device History of words you’ve seen this year
• Lock Screen / home screen widget
• Fully offline — no account, no ads, no tracking

Progress stays on your device. Open Dayink, pick a level, and let one good word settle in.

**Support URL:** `mailto:chintudon123@gmail.com` is not ideal; prefer a page. Temporary: host `docs/privacy-policy.html` (same contact) or use:

Better: publish `docs/privacy-policy.html` via GitHub Pages and reuse that site root as Support URL.

**Marketing URL:** leave blank (optional)

**Privacy Policy URL:** `https://vedanthvdev.github.io/daily-vocab/privacy-policy.html` (GitHub Pages from `docs/privacy-policy.html`).

## What this repo cannot push without you

App Store Connect metadata API needs an **App Store Connect API Key** (Issuer ID, Key ID, `.p8`). EAS holds a key for submit, but this environment does not have the `.p8` file to edit listing fields automatically.

After you add screenshots + privacy URL in Connect (or provide API key files), the listing text above is ready to paste or script.
