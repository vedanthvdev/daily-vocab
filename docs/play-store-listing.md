One calm word a day. Pick your pace — offline, no ads, home-screen widget.
```

## Full description

```
Dayink is a quiet daily vocabulary ritual.

Each day you get one word with a short, plain explanation. Choose Beginner, Intermediate, or Hard, then add the Dayink widget to your home screen so today’s word is waiting when you glance at your phone.

• One locked word per day — no endless scrolling
• Three difficulty levels
• On-device History of words you’ve seen this year
• Home screen widget (lock screen where your device supports it)
• Fully offline — no account, no ads, no tracking

Progress stays on your device. Open Dayink, pick a level, and let one good word settle in.
```

## What’s new (2.0.0)

```
Example sentences on today’s word, refreshed level catalogs, and pronunciation for the daily word.

## Privacy policy URL (required)

Publish [privacy-policy.html](./privacy-policy.html) to a public HTTPS URL (for example GitHub Pages), then paste that URL into Play Console → App content → Privacy policy.

## One-time Play Console bootstrap

Logged in as **chintudon123@gmail.com**:

1. Create app **Dayink** with package **`com.dayink.app`** if it does not exist.
2. Set privacy policy URL, Data safety, content rating, and phone screenshots.
3. Create a Google Cloud service account JSON key, enable **Google Play Android Developer API**, invite the service account in Play Console with release/testing permissions, upload the key to EAS (`eas credentials -p android`). Details: [Expo service-account guide](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md).
4. Upload the **first** production `.aab` manually to Internal testing (Play often requires this before API submits).
5. Confirm GitHub secret `EXPO_TOKEN` exists; thereafter every `master` merge runs **Release Android (Play internal)** and auto-submits to the internal track.
6. When ready for the public: Play Console → promote the internal release → **Production**.
